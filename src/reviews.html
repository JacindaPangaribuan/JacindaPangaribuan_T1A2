                <p>Jacinda has a positive, can do attitude and loves being helpful. 
                    She is very capable and a quick learner. Always up for a challenge, reliable, a good communicator and a thoughtful colleague.
                    Jacinda is also the first to break out into dance and song and isn't afraid to wear every PPE item simultaneously.</p>

                <p>I can trust Jacinda to do the behind the scenes flower preparation while I'm dealing with clients. 
                    She works efficiently and is willing to learn. During long hours, she remains cheerful and diligent.

                <p>I've known Jacinda for the past 5 years and have always found her willing to learn in all aspects of the horticultural industry.
                    Her eye for detail was second to none. It was always a joy to work with her on differing projects when our paths crossed.

                <h4 class="position">Landscape Gardener, University of Sydney</h4>
                <p>Over the three years working with Jacinda underneath me, she has grown from a shy apprentice to a competent, confident gardener.
                    Her attention to detail and calm personality makes her easy to work with.
